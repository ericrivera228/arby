Mode Feature:

	Overview:
	
		Simulation mode: Arbitrator runs as it has been. Each account has a fake amount of funds that is simulates trading with. 
			-> Exchange funds are hypothetical
				-> Account balances are NOT automatically updated.
				-> Amounts are entered from the grid.
			-> Buying and selling are simulated.
			-> Transfers are simulated and completed after an arbitrary amount of time.
			-> BTC in transfer is kept track of
			
		Live mode:
			-> Exchange funds are real
				-> Must be updated after every cycle.
			-> Real buying and selling happens
			-> Transfers:
				-> Depending on transfer mode, transfers are executed or nothing happens
				-> BTC in transfer is not kept track of
			-> Validation checker is invoked.
		
	Tech Design:
		
		#-> Create new enum class, ArbitrationMode: (DONE)!
			#-> Live
			#-> Simulation
	
		#-> Add radio button input that allows users to select mode
		#-> Add input parameter to arbitration run
			#-> Domain object
			#-> DB table
		
		#Simulation mode:
			#-> Pull starting account values from the config file
			#-> Simulated buy and sell methods are called.
			#-> Depending on transfer mode, appropriate SIMULATED transfer type is called.
			#-> BTC in transfer field is kept track of.
			
		Live mode:
			#-> On start button press, get initial account values.
			#-> At the beginning of each cycle, update account balances.
			#-> Real buy and sell methods are called.
			#-> Depending on transfer mode, appropriate SIMULATED transfer type is called.
			-> Engage validation checker after execution of validation trade
		
Transfer Mode:
		OnTrade: 
			-> Transfers are completed at the same time of the arbitration trade
		Batch (phase 1, manual)
			-> Keeps track of all the transfer that need to happen, and combines them to produces a list such that there is one transfer out of each exchange.
		Batch (phase 2, manual)
			-> Transfers are executed automatically after interval
			-> Input: Batch interval (hours). The amount of time between batch transfers
