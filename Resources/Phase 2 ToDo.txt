Required for phase 2 completion:
-> Fix rounding buy price and sell price
	-> Remember to remove rounding from the display method in Arbitration manager
	-> Go through code and figure out where rounding makes sense. (ArbitrationHunter? On the buy execution? Do I need to round at all?)	
-> Automatic lookup of trade fees (remeber to remove hard coded fees in exchange constructors)

Phase 2 clean up items:
-> Test case for saving an arbitration trade without  an arbitration run id (should through an error)	
-> Automated tests for when there isn't enough btc in the sell exchange to take advantage of all arbitration.
-> Make HelperMethods it's own project
-> Automated test for tradeFee; ensures that tradeFee as decimal is changed whenever tradeFee is set.
-> Convert all Decimal.TryParse to HelperMethods.ParseStringToDecimal

Questions to answer?
After updating fiat balance in bitstamp, should I round? (since I am converting USD to EUR)

************Completed*************
-> Make use of second gride view to display arbitration trades
-> Made balances update immediately on start.
-> Renamed and reorganized solution
-> Fixed bug in ArbitrationHunter.CalculateArbitration with AvailableBtc and AvailableFiat
-> Removed name column from db and domain object
-> Renamed SEARCH_INTERVAL column in ARBITRATION_RUN to SEARCH_INTERVAL_MILLISECONDS
-> In ArbitrationHunter.CalculateArbitration, updated while loop to stop when maxFiat is under $1.
-> Changed arbitration hunter output label
-> Finished fixing teest cases 8 and 9; updated ArbitrationHunter tests with more accurate values.
-> Added max fiat parameter
-> Ensured there are no references to Console.WriteLine
-> Put a limit on the window output.
-> Change arbitration manager thread.sleep to a timer.
-> Implemented Log4net
-> Create static ArbitrationFilter class. Come up with methods that represent the different rules. After I have come up with a couple rules, implement a UI for being able to pick the different rules.	
-> Removed ProcessId input
-> Converted tests class to automated tests
-> Converted double to decimal through program
-> Add ARBITRATION_TRADE!ARBITRATION_RUN_ID and foreign key, updated domain object as well.
-> Created test cases for insertion and deletion of arbitration opportunities.
-> Added automated tests for new MaxFiat parameter
