Report creater tech design:
	-> Every day at certain time, create entry that logs total balances
		-> Time is a config setting
		-> If it past time of day, and entry is not created, create entry
	-> Log total btc and fiat for each exchange, and also differences.
	-> Would be nice to have another sheet that displays open orders per exchange, total arbitration trades made, calculate profit, actual profit. Any useful stat regarding the trades themselves
	-> This is it's own class. (BalanceReport.Start)
		-> Constructor: BalanceReport(string logFilename)
		-> Log file name is a config setting
	-> ArbitrationManager detects when it's time for the report to run, and calls it
		-> Need to start and start arbitration (probably just continue run)
