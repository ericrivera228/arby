Required for phase 2 completion:
-> 	
-> A reset button
-> Fix rounding buy price and sell price
	-> Remember to remove rounding from the display method in Arbitration manager
	-> Go through code and figure out where rounding makes sense. (ArbitrationHunter? On the buy execution? Do I need to round at all?)	
-> Automatic lookup of trade fees (remeber to remove hard coded fees in exchange constructors)
-> Test case for saving an arbitration trade without  an arbitration run id (should through an error)	
-> Automated tests for when there isn't enough btc in the sell exchange to take advantage of all adbitration.
-> Update exchange grid to populate right after the start button is hit
-> Make use of second gride view to display arbitration trades

Nice to Haves:
-> Browse button for file name
-> Add Coinbase
